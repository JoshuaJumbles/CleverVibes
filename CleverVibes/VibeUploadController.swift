//    Updating content
//    Contentful doesn't merge changes made to content, so when updating content, you need to send the entire body of an entry. If you update content with a subset of properties, you will lose all existing properties not included in that update.
//    You should always update resources in the following order:
//    Fetch current resource.
//    Make changes to the current resource.
//    Update the resource by passing the changed resource along with current version number.
    
    
//    Updating and version locking
//    Contentful uses optimistic locking. When updating an existing resource, you need to specify its current version with the X-Contentful-Version HTTP header (this header is automatically set when using our official SDKs). Contentful compares this version with the current version stored to ensure that a client doesn't overwrite a resource that has since been updated. If the version changed in-between, Contentful would reject the update.
